<p class="ltx_p">In this research, we arrived at the boundaries
of classic science fields and are moving now through terra incognita.
The ”great journey into the unknown” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> must begin earlier and at a much lower level: revisiting the fundamental phenomena, disciplines, laws, interactions, abstractions, and omissions of science.
During that journey, we must also show which approximations are oversimplifications and which phenomena are misunderstood; measured, or interpreted in the wrong approach.
There is no independent ’life science’, only science, with the same ’first principles’ but different abstractions and approximations for living and non-living matter and proper relations between them.

Despite the efforts of the project leader, no picture can be derived about the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">elephant</span>, although <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the details of the elephant</span> are accurate.
Without aligning the knowledge elements along the first principles, ”integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines” actually lacks ”integration”. ”More Is Different” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>; at least it should be.
Without recognizing that, really, ”no single researcher or discovery
[and we add: even no ’vibrant ecosystem for rigorous and ethical research with human research participants as partners’ or ’a community effort’] will solve the brain’s mysteries”. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>
We need the ”discovery” that we need <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">different abstractions and approximations</span> for describing biological processes. However, an <a href="../ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Abstraction/index.html#Abstractions" title="abstractions ‣ § 2.2 Abstractions and approximations ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for biology ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">abstraction</a> is usable
in practice only when paired with a generalization: the more abstract the assumption, the more general and widely applicable the concept or conclusion, especially when interfacing different scientific disciplines. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">By abstractions, we can reduce the unbelievably detailed world into manageable pieces, and by abstraction, we can learn anything general.</span> Abstraction is, in fact, everywhere, including inside each of us.

<p class="ltx_p">The dynamic operation of individual neurons, their connections, higher-level organizations and connections,
the brain with its information processing capability, and finally, the mind with its conscience and behavior,

and at which point <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a living matter becomes intelligent</span> and conscious; whether and how
all this stuff can be handled by science.
We need a consistent
model that comprises all relevant interactions (and only those!) and aligns with the
notions of the related other scientific fields. Neuroscience is not an exception.
Unfortunately, nature does not care that science divides its description into disciplines.
We must care that the disciplines are aligned along different
approximations and abstractions and a cross-disciplinary research must combine them.
However, the process is not trivial and not automatic. We cannot derive an ”equation for everything”.
In the interest of being able to describe nature, one has to pass
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">between ’Scylla’ and ’Charybdis’</a>:
being still
sufficiently accurate and detailed in describing phenomena while keeping the mathematical complexity
(and computational need) of description remains still manageable.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">When describing principles of neural computing, for the same reasons, we follow the method of von Neumann’s when describing principles of technical computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>. ”The ideal procedure would be, to take up the specific parts in some definite order, to treat
each one of them exhaustively, and go on to the next one only after the predecessor is completely
disposed of. However, this seems hardly feasible. The desirable features of the various parts, and
the decisions based on them, emerge only after a somewhat <a name="zigzagdiscussion" id="zigzagdiscussion" class="ltx_anchor">zigzagging discussion</a>. It is therefore
necessary to take up one part first, pass after an incomplete discussion to a second part, return after
an equally incomplete discussion of the latter with the combined results to the first part, extend
the discussion of the first part without yet concluding it, then possibly go on to a third part, etc.
Furthermore, these discussions of specific parts will be mixed with discussions of general principles, of the elements to be used, etc.”</p>

<div id="S0.SS0.SSS0.Px2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We must also defy existing ideas and notions, shortly discuss why they show some initial successes and why they lead to wrong conclusions; furthermore, introduce new ideas (why we must combine electricity and thermodynamics instead of using them side by side in physiology; why we need to revisit physical principles to handle interactions with different speeds; which rules are valid when combining phenomena of the boundary of microscopic and macroscopic worlds; what is the true abstract operating principle of neurons; why information has a different meaning and needs different handling in technical and biological implementations).

<p class="ltx_p">We attempt to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">see the forest for the trees</span>.
Nature uses an infinite variety of implementing neurons. However, in the CNS
they can cooperate
with each other. ’Despite the extraordinary diversity and complexity of neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity,
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the nervous systems adopts <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">a number of

for all neurons and synapses’
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
In addition, they implement a complex operational (dynamic) functionality: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1705704114" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">”stimulated phase transitions enable the phase-dependent processes to replace each other … one process to build and the other

We understand that that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the fundamental task of the nervous system is to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">communicate and process information</span></span>”.
Furthermore, the ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">neurons convey
neural information</span> by virtue of electrical and chemical signals”<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
The goal was set decades ago:
’<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is
to explain <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">how electrical and chemical signals are used</span> in the brain

We base our discussion on those
general basic principles
and create an <a href="../ch_Single/sec_Single-Introduction/index.html#NeuronPhysical" title="abstract model ‣ § 1.1 Introduction ‣ Chapter 1 Abstract single neurons ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">’abstract physical neuron’</a>,
skipping the ’implementation details’ nature uses.
We want to rely on general principles and avoid implementing obsolete details for a holistic understanding. We also want to avoid hypothesizing biologically non-plausible methods and principles, creating some alternative nature.</p>

happening in a timeless world; with numerous significant consequences.
Our point of view is new and unusual; it conflicts, in many points, with the commonly accepted opinions of the respective science. Science could serve as a firm base for all its disciplines.
As we discuss, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">its disciplines use abstractions based on limited-validity approximations</span> based on the same first principles.
However, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the approximations are different for biology and physics.</span>
In physics, some processes we observe are fast enough so that we can use the <a href="../ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Abstraction/index.html#Abstractions" title="abstractions ‣ § 2.2 Abstractions and approximations ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for biology ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">abstraction</a> that they are essentially jumps between states.
In some cases, the approach can be –more or less– successful. For the slower, well-observable processes, we have the <a href="../ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Electrodiffusion/sec_Physics-LawsOfMotion/sec_Fick-Electrodiffusion.html#ElectrodiffusionLawOfMotion" title="Fick’s Second Law of Diffusion ‣ Fick’s Law for electrodiffusion ‣ § 2.5.4 Laws of motion ‣ § 2.5 Electrodiffusion ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for biology ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">Laws of Motion</a> that describe how the processes happen under the effect of some driving force.
We also experienced that nature is not necessarily linear (in the sense that it depends only on space coordinates but not on their derivatives), which we can describe by ”nice” mathematical formulas.
A century ago, A. Einstein invented that the approximations I. Newton introduced two centuries earlier are not sufficiently accurate for describing the movement of bodies. In other words, a new paradigm, the constancy of the speed of light, must have been introduced
that caused a revolution in physics and led to the birth of ”modern physics”.

<p class="ltx_p">Physiology, which serves as the ”implementation base” for neural computing, needs a similar revolution and replacing the ”classic physiology” with ”modern physiology” by introducing a new paradigm, as the partial failure (with respect to discovering secrets of neural computing) of the grandiose projects cited above has shown.
Biology stayed at a static description level, typically appropriate for describing static states.
However, the neural state changes happen at well-observable speeds, and those processes need a dynamic description instead of an ad-hoc description of state jumps.
For describing the observed phenomena –lacking the general laws of motion– case-by-case explanations are provided (in some cases lacking scientific reality), and ad hoc laws and understanding are provided.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">For the life sciences, the laws of motion (in the sense of Newton, Hamilton, and Schrödinger) are missing</span>. Even though it is stated

omitting revisiting periodically the primary hypotheses in light of new research results;
the abstractions of the classic science

applied to biological materials without revisiting their validity.
Moreover, the tradition of applying ad-hoc mathematical formulas without correct physical processes in the background (actually creating an alternative nature) instead of understanding the basics of the underlying processes.

We agree that ”The basic structural units of the nervous system are individual neurons”

we are also aware of that neurons ’are linked together

Similarly, one can also agree with von Neumann <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> and Sejnowski <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that ”whatever the system [of the brain] is, it cannot fail to differ from what we consciously and explicitly consider mathematics”; adding that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">maybe the appropriate mathematical methods are not yet invented</span>.
Our procedure still meets
the requirement given by Feynman: <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
”an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">effective procedure</em> is a set of rules
telling you, moment by moment, what to do to achieve a particular
end; it is an algorithm.” Furthermore, it considers
that “timing of spike matters”, giving way to interpreting Hebb’s learning
rule <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="../bib.html#bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>.

<p class="ltx_p">Electronics and brain research were born at the same time,
developed together, and fertilized each other. Sometimes,
the too-tight parallels led to discrepancies, from assuming
identical propagation speeds of diffusion and electromagnetic waves to using
equivalent circuits. Those wrong parallels hide the need for
introducing electrodiffusion instead of net electrical and diffusion processes, that life is governed by finite-speed (”slow”) currents and that finite-size (distributed) biological objects cannot be
directly and accurately mapped to point-like (ideal) electrical components.</p>

What makes the case worse is that, due to the lack of knowledge of the abstract way of neuron operation,
the so-called ”neural information science” uses a wrong mathematical background.

<p class="ltx_p">We agree that ”No single researcher or discovery will solve the brain’s mysteries”. However, a single researcher used to call attention to that, with the development of science and in light of discoveries, a new paradigm must be introduced. Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> advanced neurophysiology by contributing a long series of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">observations</span> on neuronal operation. They emphasized that their work
”must not be taken as evidence that their equations are anything more than an empirical description”. They made the first step of ”a great journey into the unknown” and were very cautious by saying that ”the success of the equations is no evidence in
favour of the mechanism that they tentatively had in
mind when formulating them”.
However, as they warned, many of the mechanisms must be fixed or replaced: ”must emphasize
that the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane”. We honor their outstanding work and want to supplement and enhance their interpretations and hypotheses instead of defying them. It is not possible, however. Their work became the ”Holy Bible” of physiology. The editors ’do not believe’ (see Fig.  <a href="#fig:Galilei" title="Figure 2 ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) if science advanced in the past seven decades and they <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/censor" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">censor</a>
