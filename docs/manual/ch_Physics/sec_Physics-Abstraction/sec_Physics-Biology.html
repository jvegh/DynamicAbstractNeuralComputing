<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><a name="Physics" id="Physics" class="ltx_anchor">A common fallacy in biology is that physics</a> cannot underpin the operation of living matter, citing E. Schrödinger. However, the claim falsifies his opinion by omitting the most essential word ’ordinary’.
Scrödinger wanted to emphasize the opposite: there is no new force (no unknown new interaction), only studying living matter needs different testing methods in the physical laboratory. He suggested to answer the question
”Is life based on the laws of physics?” affirmatively, but expected to discover the appropriate forms of physical laws describing the ’non-ordinary’ (in our reading: non-disciplinary) behavior of living matter. No doubt, the basic notions and terms must be interpreted precisely for living matter,
much beyond the level we used to at college level.
However, after that reinterpretation, we can interpret features of living matter, although we need a more careful, many-disciplinary analysis to do so.
We must use the appropriate abstractions and approximations for the phenomena,
depending on the level needed in the given cooperation of objects and interactions.
In this section we discuss some of the relevant terms and notions of physics,
differentiating which approximation is appropriate only for physics (mainly electronics)
and, instead, which approximation should be used for biology.
As we discuss, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">biophysics simply translated the corresponding major terminus technicus words
from the theory and practice of physics’ major disciplines, mainly from electricity, which were
worked out for homogeneous, isotropic, structureless metals,
and for strictly pair-wise interactions with a single (actually, ’instant’) interaction speed; to the structured,

non-homogeneous, non-isotropic, material mixtures and for multiple interaction speeds</span>.
Those notions do not always have unchanged meaning, and how much they do,
depends on the actual conditions. The precise meaning needs a case-by-case analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The physical models consider infinitely large volumes,
surfaces, distances; furthermore, and most importantly: instant interactions. Is the cell large enough to
consider it infinitely large (at least on the scale using ion’s size); that is to apply laws of science
derived for abstraction ’infinitely large’?
When working with charge, we know that charge is quantized, while the macroscopic quantities voltage and current are
continuous (derivable). Do cells contain a sufficient
number of charge carriers to apply macroscopic notions?
Do the thousands of times smaller ion channels transfer enough charge
to speak about well-defined current?
When a couple of ions are transferred through an ion channel,
do they change significantly the potential that accelerates them?</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Science could serve as a firm base for all its disciplines.
As we discuss, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">its disciplines use abstractions based on limited-validity approximations</span> based on the same first principles.
However, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the approximations are different for biology and physics.</span>
In physics, some processes we observe are fast enough so that we can use the abstraction that they are essentially jumps between states.
In some cases, the approach can be –more or less– successful. For the slower, well-observable processes,
we have the <a href="../sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/sec_Physics-LawsOfMotion.html#PhysicsLawsOfMotion" title="From a physical point of view, ionic solutions ‣ § 2.3.2 Laws of motion ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.2" class="ltx_ref">laws of motion</a>
that describe how the processes happen under the effect of some driving force.
We also experienced that nature is not necessarily linear (in the sense that it depends only on space coordinates but not on their derivatives), which we can describe by ”nice” mathematical formulas.
A century ago, A. Einstein invented that the approximations I. Newton introduced two centuries earlier are not sufficiently accurate for describing the movement of bodies at high speeds. In other words, a new paradigm, the constancy of the speed of light, must have been introduced
that caused a revolution in physics and led to the birth of ”modern physics”.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Life, including the brain’s operation, is dynamic.</span>
As Schrödinger formulated, the ”construction of living matter” differs
from the one science used to test in its labs.
The scientific abstraction based on ”states” (i.e., on instant changes)
fails for the case of biology, where ”processes” happen (i.e., the changes
are obviously much slower).
The commonly used measuring methods such as <a href="../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_PHYSICS_MEASURING.html#voltage-clamping" title="The very common measuring method reveals some fundamental differences between the electric behavior of conductors and living matter. ”The reason for voltage-clamping ‣ Voltage/current clamping/patching ‣ § 2.4.9 Measuring ‣ § 2.4 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.2" class="ltx_ref">clamping, patching, and freezing</a>, reduce the life to states (and correspondingly,
the related theories describe states with perturbance <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../bib.html#bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>]</cite>).
On the one side, this technology fixes the cell at some well-defined static state and enables us to observe a static anatomic picture of the cell. On the other,
it eliminates the dynamic processes, i.e., <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hides for forever the essence of the life that the cell exists in a continuous change governed by laws of motion</span>.
Those methods stop the processes for studying them, in this way killing their dynamicity to be measured.
It was forgotten that using feedback for stabilizing an autonomously
working electrical system means introducing foreign currents
and this way falsifying its operation.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Furthermore, it is hazardous to introduce technically (and incorrectly) derived
and misinterpreted macroscopic features and interpret them as fundamental
electric notions. In general, instead of understanding and developing the correct scientific base of the operation, saying that science cannot describe it. The idea of

has been introduced
to neurophysiology almost a century ago. It was taken from physics, where the
notion was derived for metals (conductors, instead of electrolytes). Since then, its original interpretation
has been forgotten, and today (in contrast with physics), it has become
a primary entity for describing electric characteristics of biological
cells. We explain how the right physics background enables us to
discover wrong physical models and
misinterpreted notions of physics in neurophysiology;
furthermore, how the right interpretation opens the way to the correct interpretation
of neuronal information. We set up an abstract electric model of neuronal
operation.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We derive the needed ’non-ordinary laws’, which are derived by using the same first principles as the ’ordinary laws’, but are abstracted for the
approximations valid for living matter.
As we discuss, those ’ordinary’ laws were derived for strictly pair-wise interactions at very high speeds.
In biology, we can observe interactions at million times smaller speed, in inhomogeneous, non-isotropic, structured material.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Biology has not the conditions for which we derived the ordinary laws of physics</span>.
We show that the ordinary laws are also the result of approximations
(including omissions) and by using the appropriate approximations for the
biological cases we can derive those ’non-ordinary’ laws of physics.
Which laws are more complex to derive and we must use several
stages (with the approximations changing from stage by stage) instead of
one single stage in the case of the ’ordinary’ laws.
However, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">all laws follow the same principles</span>.</p>

<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Biology, and especially neuronal operation, produces examples where wrong omissions
in complex processes results in absolutely wrong results. In those cases
some initial resemblance between our theoretical predictions and our phenomena exist, but the success
in simple cases provides no guarantee that the model was appropriate: ”the success of the equations is no evidence in
favour of the mechanism” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../bib.html#bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>. Finally,
all laws are approximations and the accuracy of verifying their predictions is limited.
Several theories can describe the same phenomenon with the required accuracy.
We also show in the section about the
finite interaction speeds
that the mostly known laws (from Newton, Coulomb, Kirchoff, etc.) are
also approximations. They have their range of validity, although it is often
forgotten.</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One such neuralgic point of omissions and approximations is the vastly different
interaction speeds;
furthermore, that where the speed is considered at all, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the same speed is assumed for all interactions</span>.
The laws are abstract also in the sense that, say, the objects in the laws of physics have either mass or
electric charge, but not both. It is the researcher’s task to decide
which combination of laws
can be applied to the given condition. For example, one can assume in most cases
that the speeds sum up linearly, except at very high speeds.
Biology provides excellent case studies where different interactions
shape the phenomenon and special care must be exercised.
We give a short review of
history and kinds of interaction speeds.</p>

<div id="p9" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another point is that science started with the assumption that
the non-living matter is continuous, although it was early
discovered that there are smallest pieces of that matter.
When reached that size, we experienced that different subsets
of science laws describe that matter and the atoms they contain;
in is one of the hardest tasks to establish relations between
those subsets. Again, we used abstractions that that the
continuous matter is infinitely large and that the isolated
atoms are infinitely far from each other and from the external world. We also experienced the semi-infinite cases, and studied
the behavior of surfaces and interfaces; which, again is different from both that of the atoms and their large masses. Given that biological objects are between those microscopic and macroscopic sizes, and they are surrounded by surface, we must be prepared that no simle rules describe their behavior.</p>

<div id="p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Neuronal operation is at the boundary where sometimes, in the same phenomenon,
one interaction can be interpreted at macroscopic level, some another
must already be interpreted at microscopic level.
Furthermore, a series of stages (instead of a single state) and
processes (instead of stages) describe the subject under study.
Given the vital role of charge and current in neuronal operation,
we give their precise interpretation.
Furthermore, we must consider that the processes happen in a finite volume,
