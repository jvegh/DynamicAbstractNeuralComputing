<p class="ltx_p">The <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">dynamic</span> operation of individual neurons, their connections, higher-level organizations, connections,
the brain with its information processing capability, and finally, the mind with its conscience and behavior,
are still among the big mysteries of science: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">at which point
<a href="../ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-DerivingActionPotential/index.html#LivingMatter" title="the non-living matter turns into living matter ‣ § 3.4 Action potential ‣ Chapter 3 Abstract neurophysiology ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">the non-living matter becomes a living one</a></span>,
and at which point <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a living matter becomes intelligent</span> and conscious; whether and how
all this stuff can be handled by science.
We do not understand, among others, that ”the construction [of living matter] is different from anything we have yet tested in the physical laboratory”.
Moreover, ”it is working in a manner that cannot be reduced to the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ordinary</span> laws of physics” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.

We attempt to test and describe living matter, including the brain, with methods based on the ordinary laws of science, which we concluded for non-living matter. Those <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">static</span> methods did not consider its ”special construction”.
There is no independent ’life science’, only science. with the same ’first principles’ but different abstractions and approximations for living and non-living matter and appropriate relations between them.
Without aligning the knowledge elements along the first principles, the ”integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines”, lacks ”integration”. ”More Is Different” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>. We arrived at the boundaries
of classical science fields and are moving now through terra incognita.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The ”great journey into the unknown” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> must begin earlier and at a much lower level: revisiting the fundamental phenomena, disciplines, laws, interactions, abstractions, omissions, and testing methods of science.
We understand that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the fundamental task of the nervous system is to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">communicate and process information</span></span>”.
The goal was set decades ago:
’<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is
to explain <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">how electrical and chemical signals are used</span> in the brain
to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">represent and process information</span></span>’ <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>.

However, that research must build on top of classical science, be reinterpreted for living matter, and have a correctly understood physiology.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We need a consistent
model that comprises all relevant interactions (and only those!) and aligns with the

Different science disciplines consider different details relevant; see Fig. <a href="#fig:Blind_monks" title="Figure 1 ‣ Many-disciplinarity ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

<div id="S0.SS0.SSS0.Px3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">When describing principles of neural computing, for the same reasons, we follow von Neumann’s method when describing principles of technical computing <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. ”The ideal procedure would be, to take up the specific parts in some definite order, to treat
each one of them exhaustively, and go on to the next one only after the predecessor is completely
disposed of. However, this seems hardly feasible. The desirable features of the various parts, and
the decisions based on them, emerge only after a somewhat <a name="zigzagdiscussion" id="zigzagdiscussion" class="ltx_anchor">zigzagging discussion</a>. It is, therefore,
necessary to take up one part first, pass after an incomplete discussion to a second part, return after
an equally incomplete discussion of the latter with the combined results to the first part, extend
the discussion of the first part without yet concluding it, then possibly go on to a third part, etc.
Furthermore, these discussions of specific parts will be mixed with discussions of general principles, of the elements to be used, etc.”

In our case, this zigzag way of reading
is made more accessible by using hyperlinks in the document.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Nature uses an infinite variety of implementing neurons. However, in the CNS

for all neurons and synapses’
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.


We base our holistic discussion on those

in practice only when paired with a generalization: the more abstract the assumption, the more general and widely applicable the concept or conclusion.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">By abstractions, we can reduce the unbelievably detailed world into manageable pieces, and by abstraction, we can learn anything general.</span>
We must show which approximations are oversimplifications and which phenomena are misunderstood, measured, or interpreted in the wrong approach.

Similarly, one can also agree with von Neumann <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and Sejnowski <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> that ”whatever the system [of the brain] is, it cannot fail to differ from what we consciously and explicitly consider mathematics”; adding that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">maybe the appropriate mathematical methods are not yet invented</span>.

Our procedure still meets
the requirement given by Feynman: <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>
”an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">effective procedure</em> is a set of rules

the too-tight parallels led to discrepancies, from assuming
identical propagation speeds of diffusion and electromagnetic waves to using
equivalent circuits. Those wrong parallels hide the need for
introducing electrodiffusion instead of net electrical and diffusion processes, that life is governed by finite-speed (”slow”) currents and that finite-size (distributed) biological objects cannot be
directly and accurately mapped to point-like (ideal) electrical components.
We need to connect the atomic electricity to the macroscopic one; furthermore,
in biology, concentration changes evoke potential changes and create large potential gradients. Those internal gradients may start dynamical electrical currents in biological tissues.</p>

Our point of view is new and unusual; it conflicts, on many points, with the commonly accepted opinions of the respective science disciplines.
Biology stayed at a static description level, typically appropriate for describing static states.

Considering them solves the mystery of how a biological neural network can react at a speed about two orders of magnitude higher than it could be expected based on its static behavior (the time difference between adjacent spikes) and, in general, <a href="../ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Electrodiffusion/sec_Physiology-Life/index.html#CellToLife" title="why a cell comes into life ‣ § 3.3.2 Connecting science to life ‣ § 3.3 Electrodiffusion ‣ Chapter 3 Abstract neurophysiology ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref">how life science builds on top of science</a>.

We attempt to synthesize the available knowledge with a fresh eye and intend to make a leap
in understanding neural computing,
scrutinizing our knowledge
pieces one by one for credibility, relation to other pieces, other disciplines,
finding contradictions and their resolutions, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">defying fallacies</span>.
We show how elementary neuronal operation is carried out, why biological
computing is by orders of magnitude more effective than the technical one,
how the biological implementation enables learning,
how and why do the features of the two computing systems differ..</p>

we still do not know the details and the underlying general principles

What makes the case worse is that, due to the lack of knowledge of the abstract way of neuron operation,
the so-called ”neural information science” uses a wrong mathematical background.
We understand how neurons

However, as they warned, many of the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">mechanisms</span> must be fixed or replaced: ”must emphasize
that the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane”. We honor their outstanding work and want to supplement and enhance their interpretations and hypotheses instead of defying them.
However, their work became the ”Holy Bible” of physiology. The editors ’do not believe’ (see Fig.  <a href="#fig:Galilei" title="Figure 2 ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES)" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) if science advanced in the past seven decades and they <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/censor" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">censor</a>

Likely, they did not know that science must ”have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, ’Is it reasonable?’ …If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming ’This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!’ we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.” (Richard P.
