Research must build on top of classical science, be reinterpreted for living matter, and have a correctly understood physiology.
There is no independent ’life science’, only science. They are based on the same ’first principles’ but using different abstractions and approximations for living and non-living matter and having the appropriate relations between them.
Without aligning the knowledge elements along the first principles, the ”integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines”, lacks ”integration”. ”More Is Different” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.

each one of them exhaustively, and go on to the next one only after the predecessor is completely
disposed of. However, this seems hardly feasible. The desirable features of the various parts, and
the decisions based on them, emerge only after a somewhat zigzagging discussion</a>. It is, therefore,
necessary to take up one part first, pass after an incomplete discussion to a second part, return after
an equally incomplete discussion of the latter with the combined results to the first part, extend
the discussion of the first part without yet concluding it, then possibly go on to a third part, etc.
Furthermore, these discussions of specific parts will be mixed with discussions of general principles, of the elements to be used, etc.”

In our case, this zigzag way of reading

in practice only when paired with a generalization: the more abstract the assumption, the more general and widely applicable the concept or conclusion.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">By abstractions, we can reduce the unbelievably detailed world into manageable pieces, and by abstraction, we can learn anything general.</span>
We must show which approximations are oversimplifications were done and which phenomena are misunderstood, measured, or interpreted in the wrong approach.

We attempted to test and describe living matter, including the brain, with methods based on the ordinary laws of science, which we concluded for non-living matter. Those <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">static</span> methods did not consider its ”special construction”; furthermore, they do not need (and, as a consequence, do not have) <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">dynamic</span> ”laws of motion” in the sense as science does.</p>

Essentially, we make the first steps in section <a href="../ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/index.html" title="§ 2.6 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.0.23" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.6</span></a> toward answering E. Schrödinger’s question: ”How can <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the events in space and time</span> which take place within <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the spatial boundary </span>of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> Notice the need <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">of using events and describing the spatiotemporal behavior (in other words: implementing them by slow currents in a finite volume)</span> implied in the question; three items which
our text targets.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">No presently available theoretical description and simulator can perform that task</span>.
We show that when considering the correct physics, the finite size of neuronal membranes, the finite speed of
ion currents, and the correct description of discrete to continuous transition, we can solve the mystery that the combination of non-living materials shows
<a href="../ch_Physics/sec_Physics-MembranesChannels/sec_Physics-Membranes.html#SignsOfLife" title="Similar is the case with the neuronal membrane and the neuronal operation. Now, we are at the point where their decades-old static description is insufficient. We need to derive the corresponding laws of motion to describe the neuron’s dynamic behavior. We need a meticulous and unusual analysis to derive them. In a neuron, in the abstraction science uses, we put together only an ionic solution, a semipermeable membrane, and currents that reach and leave them. All these belong to non-living matter. As experienced, at some combination of their parameters and gradients, qualitatively different phenomena happen, which, in the abstraction biology uses, are called signs of life ‣ § 2.7.1 Membranes &amp; layers ‣ § 2.7 Membranes and channels ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.0.23" class="ltx_ref">signs of life</a> at an appropriate combination of their parameter values.

<div id="S0.SS0.SSS0.Px6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We can only admire von Neumann’s genial prediction that ”the language of the brain, not the language of mathematics” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, given that most of the cited experimental evidence was unavailable at his age.
Similarly, one can also agree with von Neumann <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and Sejnowski <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> that ”whatever the system [of the brain] is, it cannot fail to differ from what we consciously and explicitly consider mathematics”; adding that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">maybe the appropriate mathematical methods are not yet invented</span>.

Our procedure still meets
the requirement given by Feynman: <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>
”an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">effective procedure</em> is a set of rules
telling you, moment by moment, what to do to achieve a particular
end; it is an algorithm.” Furthermore, it considers

that “timing of spike matters” giving way to interpreting Hebb’s learning
rule <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="../bib.html#bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, which usually remains outside of the scope of mathematics. We formulate problems, provide their numerical solutions, and open the way for mathematics to provide analytical solutions.

Not surprisingly, the need for applying new approximations for the non-ordinary laws for describing living matter needs
slightly different (in this sense, non-ordinary) mathematical formulation describing them.
We emphasize again that the first principles are the same, but the
different ”construction” of the living matter needs different – ’non-ordinary’ – approximations
and laws.</p>

The facts and observations are the same, but their interpretation may differ due to the underlying ’non-ordinary’ laws of physics.
Biology stayed at a static description level, typically appropriate for describing static states.
It sees that the electric charges are locally unbalanced
inside us, they continuously change, obeying only partly
understood laws, but its laws of motion are missing.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Neural processes</span> happen at well-observable speeds, which <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">need a dynamic description instead of an ad-hoc description of state jumps</span>.

Considering them solves the mystery of
how life science builds on top of science.

<p class="ltx_p">We understood early that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the fundamental task of the nervous system is to <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">communicate and process information</span></span>”.
The goal was set decades ago:
’<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The ultimate aim of computational neuroscience is
to explain <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">how electrical and chemical signals are used</span> in the brain

Today, computational neuroscience turned into introducing mathematical models, slightly or not related to reality, implementing them using a ”technomorph biology” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>,
while it keeps wondering why nature behaves differently.
The worst inheritances of neuroscience are the static view from anatomy and classical physiology;
omitting to revisit periodically the primary hypotheses in light of new research results;
applying the abstractions of classical science
(single speed, isolated, pair-wise, instant interactions in a homogeneous and isotropic infinite medium)
to biological materials without revisiting their validity.
Moreover, the tradition of applying ad-hoc mathematical formulas
without correct physical processes in the background (actually creating an alternative nature)
instead of understanding the basics of the underlying processes.
To start with, we introduce <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">science-based abstract dynamics</span>

as opposed to the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">empirical cell-biology’s static</span> description of neuronal operation.
We agree that ”the basic structural units of the nervous system are individual neurons”
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, but
we are also aware of that neurons ”are linked together
by dynamically changing constellations of synaptic weights” and
”cell assemblies are best understood in light of their output product” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../bib.html#bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="../bib.html#bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>

that the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane”. We honor their outstanding work and want to supplement and enhance their interpretations and hypotheses instead of defying them.
However, their work became the ”Holy Bible” of physiology.

Likely, they did not know that science must ”have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, ’Is it reasonable?’ …If we suppress all discussion, all criticism, proclaiming ’This is the answer, my friends; man is saved!’ we will doom humanity for a long time to the chains of authority, confined to the limits of our present imagination.” (Richard P.
