<p class="ltx_p">The <a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/index.html#spatiotemporal" title="In biology, it was evident that the transfer (conduction) time must be considered together with the computing (synaptic) time (in this sense, presynaptic to postsynaptic transmission time). The name ”spatiotemporal ‣ § 2.9 Spatiotemporal ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">spatiotemporal</a> neuronal operation is too complex and fast to enable a
sufficiently detailed and accurate observation of neuronal operation.
Given that the action potential involves rapid changes in membrane potential,
the genial idea (originally introduced by Cole and Curtis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>) applied by Hodgkin and Huxley <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> was to slow down (actually to ”freeze”)
its dynamics by the ”voltage clamp” device, which can set the membrane’s potential
at a particular voltage and keep it there, using electrical stimulation and feedback.

<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">This advantage of the method is its disadvantage at the same time.</span>
First, since it uses purely electric stimulation and feedback, it suggests
that the stimulated operation is also purely electrical,
hiding that it is an electrodiffusional process. Second, it enables experimenting
with ”snapshots” of the operation (the feedback fixes the neuron’s voltage, in a freezed state, to a particular value), hiding that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the operation is dynamic</span> and
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">needs a dynamic description by laws of motion</span>.
Third, the feedback the method uses means introducing
’foreign’ (external), time-dependent current into the cell, is not in their equations.</p>

Correspondingly, they have set up a classic <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">predictive description</span> (a very precise set of observations, in the form of mathematical equations), describing <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">purely electrical static processes</span>. Although they correctly determined that an influx of sodium ions through voltage-gated sodium ion channels causes a rapid shift in membrane potential, which causes the initiation of the electrical signal that is known as the action potential, their picture (which, in their opinion ”the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane”) could not accurately describe
the observations, especially their timing relations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The main goal of the BRAIN initiative was ”observing their [the neural system’s] <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic</span> patterns of activity as the circuit functions in vivo during behavior, and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">perturbing</span> these patterns to test their significance”. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> This method is exactly equivalent with the predictive <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ptolemaic-system" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">Ptolemaic system</a> for describing planetal motion, that lacked the (Newtonian) laws of motion. The “natural” expectation for the paths of celestial bodies was that they must travel in uniform motion along the most “perfect” path possible.
It presumed ”perfect” circles (without reasoning) for the planetal orbits and adapted them to the real-world planetal orbits by <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">perturbing</span> them (without reasoning why that perturbation happens), instead of discovering their laws of motion and understanding they are ellipses.
Ptolemy’s model explained the experienced “imperfection” by postulating ad-hoc that the irregular movements were due to a combination of several regular circular motions (”perturbation”) and introduced ad-hoc spheres.
The idea of the ”perfect path” had to be replaced with ”Newton’s law of universal gravitation”.
For the first look, that universal law, and without solving its differential equation, seems to have no relation to the ideal path.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">”Central to the BRAIN Initiative is the discovery, development, and dissemination of new theories”. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> However, there is no project to validate
the principles used in the so-called theoretical descriptions.
Neuroscience theory stayed at their static theory, which forms a fundamental
obstacle in front of understanding the dynamic operation of neural systems.
This is exactly why a new point of view must be introduced. The static view
means that by measuring technologies such as <a href="../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_PHYSICS_lamping/index.html#voltage-clamping" title="The very common measuring method reveals some fundamental differences between the electric behavior of conductors and living matter. ”The reason for voltage-clamping ‣ § 2.3.7 Voltage/current clamping/patching ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">clamping or freezing</a> means that
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">we forcefully prevent the gradients from changing, which change is the
life itself</span>. That view enables us to study fine details of samples taken from living materials that themselves do not live (in the sense of activity they do in their native state), and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hides that they have internal forces which move them according to their laws of motion; furthermore, that such laws exist</span>. Measuring electrical activity in a living system affects its electrical (and, through this, chemical) behavior.</p>

<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We must also defy existing ideas and notions, shortly discuss why they show some initial successes and why they lead to wrong conclusions; furthermore, introduce new ideas (why we must combine electricity and thermodynamics instead of using them side by side in physiology; why we need to revisit physical principles to handle interactions with different speeds; which rules are valid when combining phenomena of the boundary of microscopic and macroscopic worlds; what is the true abstract operating principle of neurons; why information has a different meaning and needs different handling in technical and biological implementations).</p>
