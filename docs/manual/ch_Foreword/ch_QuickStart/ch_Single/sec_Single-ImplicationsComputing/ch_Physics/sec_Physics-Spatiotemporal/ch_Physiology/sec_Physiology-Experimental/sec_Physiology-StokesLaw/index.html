<p class="ltx_p">We can spot two issues in connection with their measuring
and one with the evaluation method of their excellent measurement.
A fundamental problem to solve when measuring chemical electrolytes
using electronic devices is their interfacing. At some point, the
ionic charge must be converted to electrons (there and back), which
usually happens in electrolyte electrodes. Interfacing the analyzed
electrolytic wire and metallic wire in the measurement circuit introduces
problems, not only the contact potentials but also the time delay
due to the using electrolyte electrodes. These electrodes need to
carry the ions to some distance, and that process is outside of the
time scale of the primary measured process. The effect is noticed
but not explained <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>: “the steady state
relation between sodium current and voltage could be calculated for
this system and was found to agree reasonably with the observed curve
at 0.2 msec after the onset of a sudden depolarization.” Moreover,
given that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the speed of ions depends on the depolarizing voltage
(see Eq. (<a href="../../../../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_Physics-Current/index.html#eq:StokesCurrent" title="In Current’s speed ‣ § 2.3.3 Current ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.7</span></a>)), this time gap depends on the depolarizing
voltage</span>: the higher the voltage, the shorter the time gap, demonstrated
in their Fig. 3.
Actually, their fitted polynomial chooses a wrong time scale
and adds the delaying effect of the electrolyte electrodes
to the measured time.
Since this delay depends on the clamping voltage,
the measured time constant comprises a systematic voltage-dependent contribution, so it distorts the fitting and delivers wrong time constants.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The second issue is that they measured conductance, which measurement procedure
(as we discuss it in section <a href="../../../../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_PHYSICS_RESISTANCECONDUCTANCE/index.html#sec:PHYSICS_MEASURINGCONDUCTANCE" title="Measuring ‣ § 2.3.5 Conductance&amp;impedance ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3.5</span></a>)
means introducing a small voltage into the measured system and generating a small current in it, which – by biological mechanisms – may produce further
charge carriers inside it. The generated small current contributes to the
true current in the system, and the device measures their sum,
that is, the true current plus that offset. As long as the true current
is large (notice that the clamping voltage spans nearly two orders of magnitude),
the contribution of the device causes only a negligible distortion.
At small <a href="../../../../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_PHYSICS_lamping/index.html#voltage-clamping" title="The very common measuring method reveals some fundamental differences between the electric behavior of conductors and living matter. ”The reason for voltage-clamping ‣ § 2.3.7 Voltage/current clamping/patching ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">clamping voltages</a>, however, that contribution is comparable
to the measured effect, so it significantly distorts the measurement
and shows much higher current than the true one.</p>
</div>
<div id="p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The third issue is, that they fitted their data with a polynomial function,
which draws a ”smooth” diagram line, at low time values contracting
an initial ”no current” period with a period where the current grows exponentially. Given that the ”no current” period decreases as the
clamping voltage increases, the polynomial fits a variable composition
of current in those two periods.</p>
</div>
<div id="p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We fitted
our theoretical function (see Eq.(<a href="../../../../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_Physics-Current/index.html#eq:I_Source" title="In Current source ‣ § 2.3.3 Current ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.14</span></a>)) to their measured data published in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>, omitting the
delay period due to the electrolyte electrodes.
This way we eliminated the first and third issues. We derived the timing constant and saturation current values using the clamping voltage as parameter.
In Fig. <a href="#fig:SpeedDependence" title="Figure 3.19 ‣ § 3.6.1 Stokes-Einstein relation ‣ § 3.6 Experimental evidence ‣ Chapter 3 Abstract neurophysiology ‣ § 2.9 Spatiotemporal ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.19</span></a>, we compare our fitted data values

<p class="ltx_p">In the case of using the right function for fitting the measured current value, we receive the theoretically expected conclusion, that the time constant depends linearly on the <a href="../../../../sec_Physics-Electricity/sec_PHYSICS_lamping/index.html#voltage-clamping" title="The very common measuring method reveals some fundamental differences between the electric behavior of conductors and living matter. ”The reason for voltage-clamping ‣ § 2.3.7 Voltage/current clamping/patching ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">clamping voltage</a> (that is, on the voltage gradient), while fitting the data with the wrong (polynomial) function, the time contants show an opposite dependence. The saturation current shows in both cases a linear dependence.

<div id="p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The wrong evaluation method led Hodgkin and Huxley to conclusions opposite to the real ones, from the correct measured data. Their measurement is precise but not accurate.
It has very sever consequences: covers the presence of ”slow current” and
disables understanding the physical process happening inside the neuron.
Given that in the meantime the measurement technology developed (smaller
electrolyte electrodes with much shorter delays furthermore conductance meters
with higher internal impedance have been developed), and they coded those parameters (without the voltage-dependence we pointed out) into their polynomial coefficients (which are used in their differential equations), those issues significantly contributed to the
difficulties their followers experienced when applying their equations.</p>
