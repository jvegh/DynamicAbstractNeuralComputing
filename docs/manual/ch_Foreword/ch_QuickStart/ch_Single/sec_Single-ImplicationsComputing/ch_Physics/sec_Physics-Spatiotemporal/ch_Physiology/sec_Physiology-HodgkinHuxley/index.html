were discovered early, the principles, notions and technical equipments have been elaborated.
Even, some meticulous measurements correctly interpreted some of its signals.
The development of electronical technology enabled their systematic study
in the beginning of the 50’s. However, experimenters
often forgot that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Under ideal
circumstances, the physical act of measuring a neurophysiological event
would have no effect on the electrical signal of interest. Unfortunately,
this is seldom the case in neurophysiology.</span>” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The first systematic attempt to describe the results of observations in terms of well-known laws of electricity was published around 1952 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite><a name="HHmeasurements" id="HHmeasurements" class="ltx_anchor">.
They made a huge amount of meticulous measurements</a> and wanted to help the science community with providing equations for practical applicability.
To speed up reaching that goal, they introduced <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">empirical functions</span>
and derived equations, which, not surprisingly, described the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">empirical observations</span> quite accurately.
The importance of their work is best highlighted by that it inspired
different disciplines for discussion.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Self-evaluation</h2>

<div id="SS0.SSSx1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In their brilliant publication <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,
Hodgkin and Huxley evaluated their results ”that our equations [must not be taken as] anything more than an empirical
description” and ”the [partial] success of the
equations is no evidence in favour of the mechanism”.
When validating their observations,
they have found serious question marks: ”a number of points were noted on which the calculated behaviour of our model did not agree with the experimental results. We
shall now discuss the extent to which these discrepancies can be attributed to
known shortcomings in our equations.”
”One was that the membrane capacity was assumed to
behave as a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">’perfect’ condenser</span>, …the other was
that the equations governing the potassium conductance do not give as much
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">delay in the conductance rise</span> on depolarization as was observed in voltage clamps”.
They did have the intuition that something was wrong and they correctly guessed its reason: ”it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the changes
in ionic permeability depend on <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the movement of some component</span> of the
membrane <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">which behaves as though it had a large charge</span>.…it is necessary to suppose
that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">there are more carriers and that they react or move more slowly</span> …<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">there is no evidence from our
experiments of any current associated</span> with the change in sodium permeability, apart from the contribution of the sodium ion itself”.</p>
</div>
<div id="SS0.SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">They emphasized that their work
”must not be taken as evidence that their equations are anything more than an empirical description”. They made the first step of ”a great journey into the unknown” and were very cautious by saying that ”the success of the equations is no evidence in
favour of the mechanism that they tentatively had in
mind when formulating them”.</p>
</div>
<div id="SS0.SSSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In his late work <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib103" title="" class="ltx_ref">103</a>]</cite>, Hodgkin evaluated the filtered experiences:
”We soon realized that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the carrier model could not be made to fit certain results</span>,
for example the nearly linear instantaneous current voltage relationship, and
that it had to be replaced by some kind of voltage-dependent gate. As soon as
we began to think about molecular mechanisms it became clear that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the electrical data would by themselves yield only very general information</span> about the class
of system likely to be involved. So we settled for the more pedestrian aim of
finding a simple set of mathematical equations which might plausibly represent
the movement of electrically charged gating particles.”</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_subsubsection">Nobel-laudation</h2>

<div id="SS0.SSSx2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Unfortunately, they also attempted to understand which physical processes happen in the membrane, but they concluded with the feeling that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the interpretation given is unlikely to provide a correct picture of the membrane</span>.”
Despite their explicite warning, that ”the success of the equations is no evidence in
favour of the mechanism that we tentatively had in
mind when formulating them”.
Despite, they received the Nobel-prise ”for their discoveries concerning the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">ionic mechanisms</span> involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve”.
As the phylosphical approach to their work discusses, ”One could dismiss this curious passage as scientific modesty if it were not for the fact
that Hodgkin and Huxley argue for their conclusions.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>]</cite>
The science community rushed to apply the equations, instead of validating them.
To compensate for the disagreements with the experimental data, further ad-hoc
assumptions have been introduced, making their admittedly wrong picture even worse.</p>
</div>
<div id="SS0.SSSx2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the sense of philosophy, ”there is a widely accepted distinction between <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">merely modeling a mechanism’s behavior</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">explaining</span> it.
The equations
must be supplemented by a causal interpretation: one might, for example, agree by
convention that the effect variable is represented on the left, and the cause variables
are represented on the right, or one might add “these are not mere mathematical
relationships among variables but descriptions of causal relationships in which this
variable is a cause and this other is an effect,” and not vice versa”, for more details see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">35</a>, <a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib104" title="" class="ltx_ref">104</a>]</cite>. The lack of causality is one reasons why
HH have had the feeling they missed the correct picture of the membrane. The other reason is that some fine details of their oversimplified picture was not accurate, althought the additional (and arbitrary) ad-hoc assumptions have hidden the disagreements. The followers have ”fitted elephants” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">34</a>]</cite> by adding many more ad-hoc effects with too many parameters.</p>
