<p class="ltx_p">Ohm’s law is an empirical law, a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is a feature of the material, and not an electric phenomenon. There is a crucial difference between the current propagation’s mechanisms in solids and in biological matgerials.</p>
</div>
<div id="SSSx1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As the Drude model describes, in solids
electrons (shown in the figure in blue) constantly bounce among heavier, stationary crystal ions (shown in red).
The Drude model treats electrons like pinballs bouncing among the ions that make up the structure of the material. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field. The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field. Important that the collisions are inelastic, so the electrons lose (most of) their energy. The energy is absorbed by the solid’s gridpoints, which later is released in form of head. The process is irreversible.</p>
</div>
<div id="SSSx1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In biological matter, ions convey electricity. So called ion channels
are used for the transfer. Here diffusion and electromigration takes place. The ions traverse typically without collision, under the effect of an electric place. The process is reversible.</p>

<p class="ltx_p"><a name="electric_conductance" id="electric_conductance" class="ltx_anchor">The difficulties of making electric measurement</a> on living matter
were known since the beginnings: ”Since it is quite generally
believed that the depolarization of a nerve fiber membrane, during
excitation and propagation, involves an increased permeability to
ions there have been many attempts to detect and to measure this
change as an increase in the electrical conductivity. …
In these cases <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the measuring current was also the stimulating current</span> and it was not possible
to analyze the changes satisfactorily.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>
It is worth to recall that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">performing an electric measurement
on the operation of some electric system always represents an intervention into the
electric process of the system under study</span>; the question only is how much the measurement influences those operating processes.
Measuring the conductance of an isolating membrane, with ion channels in its wall and
slow ions flowing in its surface layers, is one of the hardest measuring tasks.
We discuss below some fine differences compared to measuring in metals.
We interpret the notions precisely below.

<p class="ltx_p">If an electric potential is applied to an ionic solution, the cations of the solution are drawn to the electrode that has an abundance of electrons, while the anions are drawn to the electrode that has a deficit of electrons. The movement of anions and cations in opposite directions within the solution amounts to a current. Notice that the current inside the electrolyte is represented by ions, in the rest of the electric circuit, by electrons; the electrode must convert
the charge carrier. The electrode actively participates in the process (even if it is a measurement), and its operation takes time.
Recall that the current delivered by the ions means at the same time a change in concentration (transport of material). If the ions can freely change their position, after some relaxation time, the driving forces due to the electric charge and the concentration balance each other as the <a href="../../sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/sec_Physics-SteadyState/index.html#NernstPlanckPositionDerivatives" title="Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion equation ‣ § 2.4.3 Steady state ‣ § 2.4 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">Nernst-Planck equation</a> describes.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">The electric measurement means an intrusion into the measured system. To measure voltage and current (we call them secondary entities), we can minimize the intervention.
However, to measure conductance, we must generate charge (see Fig. <a href="#fig:Physics-Multimeter" title="Figure 2.1 ‣ Measuring ‣ § 2.3.5 Conductance&amp;impedance ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>): we must apply some
voltage to the medium and measure the current with which the medium
responds; that is, a foreign voltage falsifies the measurement result. The fact is known in neurophysiology (but either forgotten
or not understood), see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, section
A.3.12: ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">(input impedance) can be measured by applying a voltage
and measuring the resulting current or by injecting a current and
measuring the resulting voltage</span>”. We often forget that we concluded
the notion for metals and that if the number of moved charge carriers
changes during the measurement, or a ”foreign” (not considered)
force field also affects the object, our measurement will produce
fake results; see for example electromagnetic forces and the decades-long
history of memristors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">75</a>]</cite>. Moreover,
we assumed an isotropic medium (unlike complex biological objects).
The current may delay, disappear, and re-appear in an improperly designed
measurement. It is not against the laws of physics; it is due to the
incomplete knowledge of physics.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">A ”conductance meter” device <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">actively applies a potential

resistance/conductance using Ohm’s Law from its input data that contains
”foreign” current contribution(s).

<div id="SSSx2.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is frequently forgotten that the mentioned processes ”produce”
electric charge in the measured system. Measuring conductivity actually means measuring current, see section <a href="../sec_Physics-Current/index.html" title="§ 2.3.3 Current ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3.3</span></a>. Somehow, researchers forgot
this warning and attibuted the created charge to some changed conductivity.
In the case of a biological membrane, no charge carriers are present
in its resting state. However, the applied voltage may open voltage-controlled
ion channels, and the field may move the ions through them. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The
device sees its own effect: the voltage it applies generates an ion inflow,
moves the ions it produces, and measures the resulting output current</span>.
Recall Eq.(<a href="../sec_Physics-Current/index.html#eq:StokesCurrent" title="In Current’s speed ‣ § 2.3.3 Current ‣ § 2.3 Ions’ electricity ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.7</span></a>): the current grows as the number of charge carriers <math id="SSSx2.p6.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math> increases; a real danger when measuring conductance in the presence of ion channels.
Different devices and different settings provide different conductance
values for the same membrane. (Assuming some resting conduction in
axons is a self-contradiction. To have conduction, charge carriers
need to be present, which means the presence of ions that means potential
above the resting potential. Those ions flow out to the galvanically
connected membrane. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The measurement device generates the ”resting conductance”
attributed to axons and membrane</span>.

It is a systematic error due to the incomplete understanding of the physics
of electric measurements. See Fig. 6 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>
at high clamp voltage, the device’s voltage contribution is insignificant.
However, it is at least comparable to the measured effect at low clamp
voltage.)</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Furthermore, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">one must forget to make parallels with the single-speed
electric circuits</span>, especially using their ready-made equations (used
outside their range of validity) assuming a voltage generator:
biological circuits are different. Biological interactions are governed
by more complex laws, especially if interactions at enormously different
speeds play a role. However, like in the case of modern versus classic
physics, the first principles can provide good hints in the limiting
case. If we face a controversy, we apply the wrong basic assumptions
and omissions/approximations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Ohm’s Law is valid only in its <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">differential form</span>.

The charge, whether injected artificially or natively through the synapses into the membrane,
needs time to travel from their entry point to their exit.
The two definitions are equivalent only if the current’s speed is infinitely large (instant interaction) or in other words, it does not depend on the time.
The non-differential definition fixes current
and makes material’s features variable. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The wrong definition rejects known laws of physics and introduces
new laws which it does not define.
It rejects the first principles of science and introduces empirical laws without understanding them.</span>
The misunderstanding arises from using the wrong abstraction of ”electrical
node”. In classical electricity, the abstraction
’instant interaction’ means that the node is discrete and sizeless. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Kirchoff’s law implies that the current enters and exits the node simultaneously</span>, which is not

the case in biology. It is a self-contradiction:
the change in the current’s time course (a charge related electric entity)
is transferred to the medium.
Due to the wrong definition one simply divides non-matching data value pairs and
attributes the effect of the wrong definition (using inappropriate abstraction of ”instant interaction”) to the process under study.
It is the source of a series of misunderstandings
and directs physiology towards a wrong direction (it did not ask:
why charge conservation is not valid).

In classical electricity, in the world of ’instant interaction’ the Kirchoff’s law is a
good <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">approximation</span> (but correct books also mention that on a <math id="SSSx2.p8.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="30~{}cm" display="inline"><mrow><mn>30</mn><mo lspace="0.330em">⁢</mo><mi>c</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>m</mi></mrow></math> piece of wire there exist a <math id="SSSx2.p8.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="1\ ns" display="inline"><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo lspace="0.500em">⁢</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></math> delay). However, the case is different in physiology: the speed of current is in the range of <math id="SSSx2.p8.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="m/s" display="inline"><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>/</mo><mi>s</mi></mrow></math>; there is a ”phase delay”
between the voltage and the current.</p>
