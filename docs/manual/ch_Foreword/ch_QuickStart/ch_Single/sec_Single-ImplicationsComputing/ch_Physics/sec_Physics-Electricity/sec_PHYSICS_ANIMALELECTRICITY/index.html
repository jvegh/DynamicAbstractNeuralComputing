<p class="ltx_p">The phenomenon that the body operates with electric signals was discovered about one and a half century ago <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>]</cite>,
and the idea that ”In simple cases of ionized substances both the amount of
substance and the force acting may be expressed in electrical terms” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite><a name="BiologicalCurrent" id="BiologicalCurrent" class="ltx_anchor"> shined up nearly a century ago.
The basic idea of biological current</a> was correctly defined at the beginning:
”The permeability of a membrane to a penetrating substance is
given quantitatively by the amount of the substance which crosses
a unit area of the membrane in unit time under the action of a unit
force. In simple cases of ionized substances both the amount of
substance and the force acting may be expressed in electrical terms.
Then the permeability may be ultimately converted into coulombs
per second for a square centimeter and a potential difference of 1
volt, which is the conductance, in reciprocal ohms, for a square
centimeter” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>.
However, at that time physiologically defined fine details were not known.


One must never forget that ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">movement of
ions</span> across the plasma membrane <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">results in changes of electrical potential</span>
across the membrane, and these potential changes are the primary signals
that convey biological messages” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>
(<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">using ”equivalent circuits” hides that the potential changes</span>).

In this section, we proceed along the line pointed by those latter authors in Chapter 2 of their book.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We must recall that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">this charge is delivered chemically,
i.e., it is the result of an electrodiffusion process</span>, so the concentration and the potential change simultanously.
Also, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the charge carriers are ions instead of electrons and the transfer mechanisms are entirely different</span>.
From purely simplistic considerations concerning the many orders of magnitude in the ratio of their size and mass, we see that the charge carriers have speeds differing by orders of magnitude, that requires revisiting the classic laws such as instant interaction (behind the ideas such as Kirchoff’s laws, Ohm’s law, ’retarded potential’).
Furthermore, the ions are not fixed to isolating surfaces, and some biological ”constructions” may be active elements from the point of view of electronics: the membrane may store charge (disappears) for some period and ion channels may ”produce” charge in the measured system.
Also, the molecules may dissociate and polarize under the effects of local potentials, enabling to create macroscopically different parameters such as potential and concentration, see also <a href="../../sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/index.html#Onsager_relations" title="The distribution, however, can be calculated for charge-less and size-less ’heavy point’s only. The interference of those forces and that they affect two different features of the atomic particles leads to unusual disciplinary consequences. For his discovery of the reciprocal relations in thermodynamics ‣ § 2.4 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">Onsager’s reciprocal relations</a> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>.
In the case of living matter, we must handle thermodynamical and electrical forces simultanously. The are no ’net abstract’ cases
where only electrical forces act on the ions. This feature, accompanied by the slowness and large size of the ions, requires attention and rethinking the basic notions of electricity.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We must also call attention to the dynamic behavior of charges
inside living matter. Basically, they are balanced, but, and it is vital for describing the life, they can get unbalanced in a local region for shorter or longer periods. This balanced state is the basis for having a resting potential (longer), and the perturbed (unbalanced) state is the basis for creating and transferring action potential, among others. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">The change of those states are described by the laws of motion, and their continuous change is the life itself.</span></p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Although it is fundamentally correct that ”because dissociated ions carry electric charges, their movement is influenced not only by concentration gradients but also by electric fields”, these gradients are competing with each other and their complex interaction controls the biological processes. ”Based on thermodynamic principles,
ions tend to flow from regions of high concentrations to regions of low
concentrations” (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, page 9), furthermore, the electric gradient gets more role than presumed; see <a href="../../sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/index.html#Onsager_relations" title="The distribution, however, can be calculated for charge-less and size-less ’heavy point’s only. The interference of those forces and that they affect two different features of the atomic particles leads to unusual disciplinary consequences. For his discovery of the reciprocal relations in thermodynamics ‣ § 2.4 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">Onsager’s reciprocal relations</a> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib69" title="" class="ltx_ref">69</a>]</cite>.
We must never forget that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">ions represent both charge and mass,
so a current means delivering mass and vice versa</span>.
In some cases, when precisely measuring the time course of current
compared to the time course of voltage, one can experience a ’phase delay’
between them. This may inspire further research, such as inventing
’inductive’, ’capacitive’ and ’resistive’ currents in electricity; or one may believe
that the system shows ’non-ohmic’ behavior in biology; that is, it cannot be described
by laws of physics.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">An often forgotten thought is that
”The things that neurophysiologists typically want to measure
are electrical signals such as action potentials and synaptic potentials,
or the membrane currents responsible for these potentials. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Under ideal
circumstances, the physical act of measuring a neurophysiological event
would have no effect on the electrical signal of interest. Unfortunately,
this is seldom the case in neurophysiology.</span>” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, Appendix A. We do not want to repeat the content of that appendix, except some
points where we add notes, corrections or pinpointings.
We add, however, that neurophysiologists make measurements in
hybrid circuits, where the charge carriers are ions in one half of the circuit and electrons in the other. The conversion introduces several issues, among others delays (resulting
in measuring non-matching value pairs); introducing negatively
charged high-speed particles into systems having positively charged low-speed particles; intermixing inhomogenous, non-isotropic, structured matter into the systems and applying laws
derived for homogeneous, isotropic, unstructured matter; applying laws derived for the ”free electron cloud” to the case of slowly moving dipole molecules.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is worth to recall: ”<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Accuracy</span>: The degree to which a measurement indicates the true magnitude of a measurable quantity. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Precision</span>: The resolution and reproducibility of a measurement; implies nothing about accuracy. A measurement can be precise without being accurate. The reverse, however, is usually not true.” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> We add: sometimes, we measure a quantity which differs from the one we wanted to measure. Especially, if we interpret erronously what we wanted to measure and how do we measure it.</p>
