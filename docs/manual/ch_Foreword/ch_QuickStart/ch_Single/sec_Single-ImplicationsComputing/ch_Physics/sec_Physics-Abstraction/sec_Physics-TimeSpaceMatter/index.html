<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Classical physics is based on the Newtonian idea that space and time are absolute so everything happens simultaneously. Moreover, all interactions (and their observation) have the same speed. Consequently, when their objects
interact, it must be instantaneous; in other words, their
interaction speed is infinitely large. Furthermore, electromagnetic
waves with the same high (logically, infinitely high) speed inform the observer. This
self-consistent abstraction enables us to provide a ”nice”
mathematical description of nature in various phenomena: the classic
science. In the first year of college, we learned that the idea resulted
in ”nice” reciprocal square dependencies, Kepler’s and Coulomb’s
Laws. We discussed that the macroscopic phenomenon ”current” is
implemented at the microscopic level by transferring (in different
forms) ”atomic” charge, and that movement of charges has no effect on the environment. Furthermore, that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">without charge (and, without atomic charge carriers),
neither potential nor current exists</span>. In the following year, we learned
that the speed of light is finite and that solids show a macroscopic
behavior ”resistance” against forwarding microscopic charges.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Biology, and especially neuronal operation, produces examples where wrong omissions
in complex processes results in absolutely wrong results. In those cases
some initial resemblance between our theoretical predictions and our phenomena exist, but the success
in simple cases provides no guarantee that the model was appropriate: ”the success of the equations is no evidence in
favour of the mechanism” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. Finally,
all laws are approximations and the accuracy of verifying their predictions is limited.
Several theories can describe the same phenomenon with the required accuracy.
We also show in the section about the
finite interaction speeds
that the mostly known laws (from Newton, Coulomb, Kirchoff, etc.) are
also approximations. They have their range of validity, although it is often
forgotten.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One such neuralgic point of omissions and approximations is the vastly different
interaction speeds;
furthermore, that where the speed is considered at all, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the same speed is assumed for all interactions</span>.
The laws are abstract also in the sense that, say, the objects in the laws of physics have either mass or
electric charge, but not both. It is the researcher’s task to decide
which combination of laws
can be applied to the given condition. For example, one can assume in most cases
that the speeds sum up linearly, except at very high speeds.
Biology provides excellent case studies where different interactions
shape the phenomenon and special care must be exercised.
We give a short review of
history and kinds of interaction speeds.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another point is that science started with the assumption that
the non-living matter is continuous, although it was early
discovered that there are smallest pieces of that matter.
When reached that size, we experienced that different subsets
of science laws describe that matter and the atoms they contain;
in is one of the hardest tasks to establish relations between
those subsets. Again, we used abstractions that that the
continuous matter is infinitely large and that the isolated
atoms are infinitely far from each other and from the external world. We also experienced the semi-infinite cases, and studied
the behavior of surfaces and interfaces; which, again is different from both that of the atoms and their large masses. Given that biological objects are between those microscopic and macroscopic sizes, and they are surrounded by surface, we must be prepared that no simle rules describe their behavior.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Neuronal operation is at the boundary where sometimes, in the same phenomenon,
one interaction can be interpreted at macroscopic level, some another
must already be interpreted at microscopic level.
Furthermore, a series of stages (instead of a single state) and
processes (instead of stages) describe the subject under study.
Given the vital role of charge and current in neuronal operation,
we give their precise interpretation.
Furthermore, we must consider that the processes happen in a finite volume,
