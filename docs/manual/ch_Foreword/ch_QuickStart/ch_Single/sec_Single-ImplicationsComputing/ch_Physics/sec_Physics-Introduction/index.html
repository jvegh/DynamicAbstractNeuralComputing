<div id="p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The roles of time, space and matter are the subjects of endless debates in science.
Considering finite interaction speeds is against using a ”nice and classical physics”
with its nice mathematical formulas, but omitting the different speeds
misled and may mislead research in several fields.
Biology produces situations where the complexity of phenomena
and the needed carefulness meets the ones needed in cosmology.
The difference is that, in biology, the consequences of phenomena are immediate
and they can be studied experimentally.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">To describe the related
phenomena, we must scrutinize, case by case, which interactions are significant and
which interaction(s) can be omitted; instead of setting up ad-hoc models that contradict
each other if used outside their narrow range of validity. To provide their
correct physics-based description, we must understand the corresponding behavior of living material, including that it works with slow ion currents,
electrically active, non-isotropic, structured materials,
and consequently, its temporal behavior (the speeds of interactions)
matters. We must consider macroscopic and microscopic phenomena at the same time, different
science fields, and their interplay. ”<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1705704114" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">Living complex systems in
particular create high-ordered functionalities by pairing up low-ordered
complementary processes, e.g., one process to build and the other
to correct</a>”. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>]</cite>

We need to
check the validity of our abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div id="p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Galilei said, ”Mathematics is the language in which God has written
the universe”. However, it is not sure that when we attempt to read

a piece of the universe written in that language, we use the right
piece of the language, and even that humans already invented the
needed piece.
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus" title="" class="ltx_ref ltx_href">mathematical calculus</a>
(integral and differential) was invented mainly for the practical needs of analyzing spatial motion of celestial bodies.
Similarly, Minkowski’s mathematics theory proliferated widely  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>]</cite>


only after inventing the special theory of relativity.
Although the mathematical description was developed earlier, there was no practical
need to apply it.
The classical laws of motion were valid only until more meticulous observations required
to consider speed and acceleration (time derivatives of position) dependence in addition to position dependence.
Newton’s <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">static</span> laws remained valid, but for the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">dynamic</span> description we must revisit the second law of motion.</p>
</div>
<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Also, we must not forget that ”mathematics is not just a language. Mathematics is a language plus reasoning. It’s like a language plus logic. Mathematics is a tool for reasoning.” (Richard P. Feynman)
Mathematical formulas work with numbers but math theorems and statements begin with ”If … then”.
They have their range of validity, even when they describe nature.
Using mathematics to describe the classical equations of motion,
to calculate forces and times that speed up bodies
above the speed of light is possible, but in that case mathematics is applied to
an inappropriate approximation to nature. When approaching the speed of light,
different physical approximations (that calls for different mathematical handling) are to be used.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">A mathematical formula, without naming which interactions it describes
and naming
under which conditions and approximations the formula can be applied, are just numbers without meaning.
It surely describes something but only eventually describes what we studied.</span>
Galilei made measurements with objects having friction, but his careful analysis
extrapolated his results to the abstraction that no friction was present.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">We know his name because of making meticulous abstractions and omissions (and mainly:
recognizing the need to do so!)</span> instead of publishing a vast amount of
half-understood measured data.</p>
</div>
<div id="p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Science, unfortunately, is separated into classical and modern science
based on whether the theoretical description assumes infinitely fast
interaction (the Newtonian model) or acknowledges the finite interaction
speed (the Einsteinian model). However, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the finite interaction speed
is erroneously associated with the speed of light and frames of reference
moving relative to each other with speeds approaching the speed of
light</span>. Assuming that the interaction speed is finite is sufficient to
build up the special theory of relativity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> (using the speed
of light as the value for its external parameter).
Still, the Minkowski-mathematics <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite> behind the
special theory of relativity works with any speed parameter <math id="p5.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="c" display="inline"><mi>c</mi></math>.
The same mathematics describes technical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite>
and biological <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="../sec_Physics-Spatiotemporal/ch_Physiology/sec_Physiology-Fallacies/sec_Physiology-FallaciesAPThresholds/ch_Computing/sec_Computing-ActionPotential/ch_Information/ch_Multiple/ch_Intelligence/sec_Information-Cognition/ch_Simulation/GTKWave_Simulator/bib.html#bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite> computing
systems, where there are no moving reference frames, but the finite
interaction speed has noticeable effects on the operation of the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Another main source of confusion is that the phenomena happen in a limited region of space, and we study processes (in a period instead of a moment) where the environment is not ”infinitely far” from the studied object and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the studied process interacts with its environment</span>. We must consider that the resources are finite.</p>
