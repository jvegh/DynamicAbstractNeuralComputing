<p class="ltx_p">Our abstract physical neuron shows different faces towards different scientific disciplines.
Those faces are more or less different in the classical and our ”modern”
view. We mean we discuss the latter but mention the former, evaluating the
wrong hypotheses and the discoveries that vitiate the old picture and introducing the new one. Unlike in the old view, we check the consistency
of the different views between each other.
In the old picture,
the neuron is static and a hidden (empirical) mechanism controls its operation.
It provides an over-detailed biological description that includes
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">static</span> currents and assumes fake (physically unrealistic) operating details.
The new picture is based on a correct physics background.</p>

By discipline, it belongs
to thermodynamics and electricity. Both disciplines have terms interpreted
in microscopic and macroscopic terms. What makes the case similar to
the well-understood electromagnetism is that two kinds of force fields
act simultaneously on the object under study. What makes the case fundamentally
different is that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the force fields’ propagation speeds differ by several orders
of magnitude</span>. We must derive new mathematical methods for handling
different interaction speeds. We succeeded in
providing the driving forces and
the ”laws of motion” (the time course) of electrodiffusional processes, see section <a href="../../sec_Single-ImplicationsComputing/ch_Physics/sec_Physics-Thermodynamics/index.html" title="§ 2.4 Ions’ thermodynamics ‣ Chapter 2 Physics for neurons ‣ § 1.5 Implications for computing ‣ Chapter 1 Single neurons ‣ Quick Start ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4</span></a>.</p>

Its condenser is equipped with several gated inputs (the
neural condenser gates its inputs depending on its voltage),
and an ungated output. It needs to work out the handling of
bio-electric processes, where the ”charge production” by the biological objects
combined with delays due to the finite speed and finite size.
One must take special care when applying laws, for example,
conservation has a form that differs from the one used in classical physics.
For mathematics, it is a set of differential equations (per-stage
differing boundary conditions); time-aware and biology-aware
algorithms; unusual mathematical methods such as result-depending
integration limits; handling the one-way synchronized cooperation
of neurons; biologically faithfully reproducing neural learning;
among others.
For programming and simulation, a neuron is an event-controlled object with its <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">simulated local time</span>,
which is independent of the wall-clock time; number and structure of the
neurons in the computation and the computing architecture.
It needs faithfully reproduced timing relations, and because of the steep
derivative functions, adaptive numerical solving algorithms; handling
neuron-local and neurassembly-local simulated times to keep the system synchronized;
among others. Of course, separating the disciplines cannot be perfect; some repetitions and intensive <a href="../../../../index.html#zigzagdiscussion" title=". ”The ideal procedure would be, to take up the specific parts in some definite order, to treat each one of them exhaustively, and go on to the next one only after the predecessor is completely disposed of. However, this seems hardly feasible. The desirable features of the various parts, and the decisions based on them, emerge only after a somewhat zigzagging discussion ‣ Zigzag reading ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">zigzaging</a> are inevitable.</p>
