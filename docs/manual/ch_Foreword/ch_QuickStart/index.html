<p class="ltx_p"><a name="NewUnderstanding" id="NewUnderstanding" class="ltx_anchor">As the Human Brain Project formulated, to enter a new level,
”a new understanding</a> of the brain” is needed. It is also correct that ”integration between data and knowledge from different disciplines, and catalysing a community effort” is requested. It really needs several disciplines, openness, and deep knowledge of the related disciplines from the researchers, furthermore also <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">some knowledge about the bridges to the other disciplines</span>, as Feynman expressed. Furthermore, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">finding the extraordinary laws of physics</span>, including <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">developing the needed mathematical handling</span>, as Schrödinger expected. Moreover, after that, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">a community effort along the principles of the new theoretical understanding</span> for validating it is needed and revisiting the interpretation of the results of former observations in light of the ”new understanding”.
The present content was written in the spirit of Feynman that we
must ”have no respect whatsoever for authority; forget who said it and instead look what he starts with, where he ends up, and ask yourself, ’Is it reasonable?’”. Reading it needs the same attitude.
It needs much patience; the more patience and effort, the more the reader knows about the subject in the ”old understanding”. The ”new understanding”, the ”extraordinary laws” of physics, spiced with newly developed mathematics,
is not easy, not quick, and not effortless; furthermore, it requires a well-controlled thinking, much above the level ”this way we used to interpret the things and reply to this question for decades”. Our discussion is a much more faithful description of neurons’ operation than the old one.</p>

The site is about neuron-based computing, which, for today, may mean
very different topics. The primary goal is to deal with biologically
implemented neurons’ operation (they are created ’as is’; maybe not entirely understood,
but attempting to discover it) and also artificially manufactured neurons
which attempt to imitate the biological ones, grasping one or more
of their proper features; furthermore, their networks, operations, features
and fallacies. A further goal is to understand the features of their
larger assemblies, and how they implement advanced computations.</p>

<div id="p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Physiology, with its static view, relies on biophysics, which applies
the existing (’ordinary’) laws of classic physics in an inadequate way,
and the classic physics derived its laws for ’another construction’;
that is, biological matter also needs different mathematical
formalism. All this is derived here in a disciplinary way,
needing <a href="../index.html#zigzagdiscussion" title=". ”The ideal procedure would be, to take up the specific parts in some definite order, to treat each one of them exhaustively, and go on to the next one only after the predecessor is completely disposed of. However, this seems hardly feasible. The desirable features of the various parts, and the decisions based on them, emerge only after a somewhat zigzagging discussion ‣ Zigzag reading ‣ Foreword ‣ Dynamic Abstract Neural Computing with Electronic Simulation (DANCES) Version 0.1.0" class="ltx_ref">zigzag reading</a>.

As emphasized many times, we confine our discussion to some abstract
disciplinary level, with pointers to special topics.
We interpret known physiological evidence on top of the correct ’extraordinary’ laws of physics and derive the needed mathematical handling
separately but in parallel with that physics.
The physiological conclusions should be understood even if you do not
understand the underlying physics and mathematics details.
If you understand <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">why</span> the non-ordinary physical laws for
living matter are more or less different from the ordinary ones
for non-living matter, you may leave the details for your expert colleagues.
Mathematical handling also involves the fundamental principles
of using the abstractions and approximations of constructing
laws for physics and needs a thorough knowledge of both fields.
Anyhow, you will need to know that college-level physics
is usually not sufficient to understand the deepness of the material
and you will need to re-read the notions; the more you know it (and especially
the more false biophysics you learned) the more carefully. A half-understanding
of the physical base hinders your learning and development of brain science.

<p class="ltx_p">Although the brain’s activity is traditionally called computing,
we show that it can be considered computing only in general.
Similarly, we must reinterpret the notion of information and its processing for the brain.
These chapters build on top of the former ones, although only slightly connected to them.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">We separate the operation of single neurons from the cooperation of neurons, a vital point for understanding the brain’s elementary operation.
We also provide hints how those operations affect intelligence.</p>
